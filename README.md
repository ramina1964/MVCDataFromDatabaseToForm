# MVC Data From Database To Form
This application puts together small pieces by building a Sql Server database layer, a data access layer using Dapper, and a
GUI layer on the top, i.e., ASP.NET MVC Core. On the GUI layer we collect user data and put it to the database. Then we go backward,
by getting the data from the database and the whole way to the GUI. The goal is to show the data access process from beginning to
end in ASP.NET MVC.
